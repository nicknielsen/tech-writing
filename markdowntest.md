Here is a paragraph. It contains the most detailed content. After a line break, I'll introduce myself.

I'm Nick Nielsen, and I am a writer and editor currently working in marketing. I'm learning Markdown to expand my skillset and become a more capable technical writer. I graduated from *the* University of Texas at Austin with a bachelor's degree in Rhetoric and Writing. With no technical background, I've got my work cut out for meâ€”but that's part of the fun of it!
